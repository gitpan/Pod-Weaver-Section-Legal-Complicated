Pod::Weaver::Section::Legal::Complicated - add a pod section with multiple authors, copyright owners and licenses in a file basis

=head1 VERSION

version 1.00

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<weaver.ini>

  [Legal::Complicated]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is aimed at distributions that have several files, each of them with
possibly different authors, copyright owners and licenses.

It will look for these values in comments of the source code (analyzed
through a C<ppi_document>) with the following form:

  # AUTHOR:  John Doe <john.doe@otherside.com>
  # AUTHOR:  Mary Jane <mary.jane@thisside.com>
  # OWNER:   University of Over Here
  # OWNER:   Mary Jane
  # LICENSE: GPL_3

This example would generate the following POD:

  =head1 Legal

  =head2 Authors

  John Doe <john.doe@otherside.com>
  Mary Jane <mary.jane@thisside.com>

  =head2 Copyright and License

  This software is copyright of University of Over Here, and Mary Jane, and
  released under the license of The GNU General Public License, Version 3,

Note that this plugin makes a distinction between the authors (whoever wrote the
code), and the actual copyright owners (possibly the person who paid them to
write it).

I am not a lawyer myself, any feedback on better ways to deal with this kind of
situations is most welcome.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
